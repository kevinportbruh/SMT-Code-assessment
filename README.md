# Coding Assessment Submission

Hello! 
My name is Kevin Portillo, and I created the files included in this repository as part of the SMT coding assessment. 
I want to express my gratitude for this opportunity to showcase my coding abilities and style.

# Overview

I have put significant effort into making this submission a strong representation of my programming skills. Here's what you can expect from my code:

## Coding Problems

Each coding problem is solved with careful thought and clear implementation.

Robust comments are included within each method to explain both the code and the mathematical formulas used.

I included a menu-driven program for easy testing of all the problems:

You can run the menu to interactively test the methods multiple times without recompiling.

Alternatively, you can comment out the menu logic and directly call the methods in the main function for prewritten test cases.

## Tic-Tac-Toe

The Tictactoe implementation follows the guidelines provided, focusing on backend logic without a UI.

I spent the allotted time implementing a comprehensive unit testing system, which demonstrates the robustness of the code.

Each method is documented extensively to ensure clarity and understanding of its functionality.
### Tic-Tac-Toe Unit Tests
As per the document I have written a program to unit test my tictactoe implementation. This is the main way to interact with the app at the moment as the requirment as to not make a UI for the program.
This is what runs when you use the makefile. Some of the unit tests accecpt a boolean parameter (all of them are set to false at the moment). This parameter turns on the debugging option of the program which prints various debugging messages to the console to get a better understanding of how the program is working. Simply pass a value of true to the method calls in main and recompile it with the makefile commands to see the debuging output in the console!

# How to Run

I have included a Makefile to simplify the build and execution process. You can use the following commands:

make coding - Builds the coding-problems executable.

make runcoding - Runs the coding-problems program.

make tester - Builds the tictactoe-tester executable.

make runtester - Runs the tictactoe-tester program.

make clean - Cleans up object files and executables.

# Final Thoughts

Thank you again for this opportunity. I am proud of the work I've done and excited to share it with you. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Best regards, 
Kevin Portillo.
